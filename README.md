# Meat-Stew-Alternate-Recipes
This is my first mod, and this readme is just something I threw together. Hope it makes sense.

Example recipe additions, making Meat Stew craftable using various protein items.

A total of 13 additional recipes replacing the primary protein used in the Meat Stew recipe with the various other protein items.
Protein substitutes included: Large Beef Ration, Chicken Ration, Lamb Rations, Can of Cat Food, Can of Dog Food, Can of Chili, Can of Tuna, Can of Sham, Can of Salmon, Chicken Soup, Charred Meat, Boiled Meat, and Grilled Meat.

Installation Instructions:
Put the extracted folder and it's contents into C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods.

The final file path should have the ModInfo.xml located at:
"...Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods\Meat-Stew-Alternate-Recipes\ModInfo.xml"
and the included Config folder in the same location.

EG:
...\Mods\Meat-Stew-Alternate-Recipes
